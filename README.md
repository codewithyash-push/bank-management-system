“Bank  Management System using Python and MySQL.” 
This software project is developed to automate the functionalities of a local bank named HITA BANK in the city. The purpose of the software project is to develop the Management Information System (MIS) to automate the record keeping of the account holders and other necessary information regarding the proper functioning of the bank.  
 A MIS mainly consists of a computerized database, a collection of inter-related tables for a particular subject or purpose, capable to produce different reports relevant to the user. An application program is tied with the database for easy access and interface to the database. Using Application program or front-end, we can store, retrieve, and manage all information in proper way.
